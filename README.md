# FruitSense: Smart Fruit Assesment

This project harnesses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to develop a deep learning-based system for fruit classification and ripeness detection, aimed at improving efficiency in agricultural and food industries. By training the CNN model on a diverse dataset, it adeptly identifies various fruit types and assesses their ripeness stages. The outcomes demonstrate the model's capability in automating sorting and quality control processes, marking a significant advancement in fruit processing and distribution.
