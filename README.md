# FruitSense: Smart Fruit Assesment

This project harnesses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to develop a deep learning-based system for fruit classification and ripeness detection, aimed at improving efficiency in agricultural and food industries. By training the CNN model on a diverse dataset, it adeptly identifies various fruit types and assesses their ripeness stages. The outcomes demonstrate the model's capability in automating sorting and quality control processes, marking a significant advancement in fruit processing and distribution.

python3 app.py
```

You will get 2 links open anyone of them in your browser and you sould get UI built with `Gradio` and VOILA!!! upload any of the 6 Fruits the model is trained for and use it. 

You can also train the model for more number of fruits to scale it. Feel free to connect and ask any quries.
